                This is for Individuals with Disabilities or Access and Functional Needs: The likelihood that you and your family will recover from an emergency tomorrow often depends on the planning and preparation done today.  While each person’s abilities and needs are unique, every individual can take steps to prepare for all kinds of emergencies from fires, floods, and power outages to potential terrorist attacks.  By evaluating your own personal needs and making an emergency plan that fits those needs, you and your loved ones can be better prepared.  This app outlines actions older Americans, individuals with disabilities, special needs, and their caregivers can take to start preparing for emergencies before they happen.<br/><br/>
                
                
                <strong>CREATING A PERSONAL SUPPORT NETWORK</strong></br>
                List people who assist you on a daily basis and friends and family who may be able to assist you in case of an emergency and include their contact information.  Ask the people on this list to help in creating your plan. Be sure to include a friend or relative in another area who would not be impacted by the same emergency and who can help if necessary.<br/>
                Make sure someone in your personal support network has an extra key to your home and knows where you keep your emergency supplies.  Teach them how to use any lifesaving equipment or administer medicine in case of an emergency as well as wheelchairs, oxygen, or other medical equipment
                Practice these plans with everyone in your network.<br/><br/>
                
                <strong>ASPECTS OF YOUR PLAN</strong></br>
                List modes of transportation you use and possible alternatives that could serve as a back-up.  If you require handicap accessible transport, be sure your alternatives are also accessible.  If you have tools or aids specific to your disability, plan how you would cope without them.  Also make sure that a trusted family member or friend has a copy of your important documents as a back-up.  Be sure to include names and numbers for medical providers.  If you typically rely on elevators, have a back-up plan in case they are not working.  If you receive additional treatments administered by a hospital or clinic, talk with your service provider about making emergency plans.  Identify back-up service providers in your area.  Talk to a service provider about making sure there are plans in place to be able to operate medical equipment during a power outage.<br/><br/>
                
                <strong>SERVICE ANIMALS AND PETS</strong></br>
                Keep in mind that what’s best for you typically is what’s best for your animals.  If you must evacuate, take your pets with you, if possible.  Some shelters will have accommodations for your pet.  It is also a good idea to plan in advance for shelter alternatives that will work for both you and your animals; consider loved ones or friends outside of your immediate area, pet-friendly shelters, pet-friendly hotels and veterinarians who would be willing to take in you and your pets in an emergency.<br/><br/>
