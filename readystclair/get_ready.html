In our busy lives emergency preparedness is only one issue that we face. Emergency preparedness is insurance that in an event the ability to be a survivor dramatically increases. In our county we face numerous hazards including weather, chemical releases, and utility failures. These events do not occur every day and often become a lessor priority until the emergency occurs. Often an unprepared reaction to an emergency situation places your families in grave danger, positions businesses to be unable to provide essential services the public expects and relies on, and most of all overburdens our emergency responders. <br/><br/>
Every person, family, and business should be prepared to handle emergencies. Preparedness requires a plan, first aid training, and a well-stocked emergency supply kit. Know your community's evacuation routes, shelters, and procedures. Retrain annually and restock the emergency supplies on a regular basis. <br/><br/>

<b>First Aid Training </b>
Get certified in basic first aid and CPR training; it is vitally important to know what to do if someone gets hurt or sick. Various organizations regularly offer first aid and CPR certification courses. Additional preparedness training can teach you how to respond to disasters like floods, chemical releases, tornados, and utility failures. <br/><br/>

<b>Emergency Supply Kits </b>
Every home should have a well-stocked emergency supply kit. The kit should include at least a three-day supply of food and water, pet food, basic first aid supplies, protective equipment, and prescription medicines. Include flashlights, candles, and a battery-powered radio. Organize the supplies in a portable container so they can be carried with you if you must evacuate your home. <br/><br/>

<b>Emergency Plans and Procedures </b>
Make an emergency plan and be sure everyone in your family or business knows it. The plan should include an evacuation procedure with a specified gathering location. Make an emergency procedure checklist as well as a phone list with important contacts. Know how to shut off the utilities. Keep copies of important records and a reserve supply of cash. Review the plan and practice regularly so everyone involved remembers what to do.
