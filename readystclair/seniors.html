The senior citizen should write down an emergency plan and prepare an emergency kit. They should review their home and ensure there is an exit route which is kept clear and accessible. If there are other people in the house the family should have an agreed meeting point, just outside the house, and also outside the neighborhood. A senior in an assisted living facility should discuss their plan with the manager and staff, and these employees should tell the senior where their emergency kit is stored. 
<br><br><b>Provisions</b><br/>
The senior person should have enough water and food in the house to last for at least three days. This should be stored safely and should include canned food and a can opener. They should make provision for any medication they need to take; writing a list of medicines and dosages. They should have a flashlight and batteries which are always kept in the same place. A first aid kit should be in an accessible place and should include a cell phone with batteries and charger, and a radio. If they own pets they need to consider a plan for the evacuation of their dog, cat, or other pet.<br/><br/>
It is a good idea to make copies of medical insurance, wills, inventory of household goods, and marriage and birth certificates. Paper copies of these documents can be made and stored in a waterproof pouch. The older person may want to store special photographs or the negatives in a safe accessible place or take copies and save them on a remote computer. 

<br><br><b>Disabilities </b><br/>
Any household which includes a wheelchair user or a person with poor mobility should make sure that access to and from the house is adequate and kept clear. The senior citizen should make an evacuation plan and should practice this. 
<br><br><b>Contact </b><br/>
The senior should have three people who can be contacted in the case of an emergency. They need to discuss this with those people and their main telephone numbers should be clearly visible in their home.
