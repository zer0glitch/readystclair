                Hazardous materials in various forms can cause death, serious injury, long-lasting health effects, and damage to buildings, homes, and other property. Many products containing hazardous chemicals are used and stored in homes routinely. These products are also shipped daily on the nation's highways, railroads, waterways, and pipelines.
                <br/>
                
                Hazardous materials are substances that, because of their chemical nature, pose a potential risk to life, health, or property if they are released. Hazards can exist during production, storage, transportation, use, or disposal of such substances. The best way to protect yourself and your family is to be familiar with the potential dangers, and be prepared to evacuate or shelter-in-place.
                <br/>
                Whether you are at home, work or elsewhere, there may be situations when it's simply best to stay where you are and avoid any uncertainty outside. If you are required to shelter in place, you should:
                •              Bring your family and pets inside.
                •              Lock doors, close windows, air vents and fireplace dampers.
                •              Turn off fans, air conditioning and forced air heating systems.
                •              Take your emergency supply kit unless you have reason to believe it has been contaminated.
                •              Go into an interior room with few windows, if possible.
                •              You should watch TV, listen to the radio or check the Internet often for official news and instructions as they become available
