                <b>BLACK OUT - POWER OUTAGE</b><br/>
                
                According to the US and Canada Outage Taskforce, On August 14, 2003, large portions of the Midwest, Northeast United States and Ontario, Canada, experienced an electric power blackout. The outage affected an area with an estimated 50 million people and 61,800 megawatts (MW) of electric load in the states of Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New Jersey and the Canadian province of Ontario. The blackout began a few minutes after 4:00 pm Eastern Daylight Time (16:00 EDT), and power was not restored for 4 days in some parts of the United States. We all have our stories about those days but truthfully how prepared were we? Before another one happens let’s learn from our own experiences to be able to survive for 72 hours on our own:<br/>
                <br/>
                ·         Only use a flashlight for emergency lighting. Never use candles as they can be a fire hazard!<br/>
                ·         Turn off electrical equipment you were using when the power went out.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
                ·         Avoid opening the refrigerator and freezer.<br/>
                ·         Do not run a generator inside an enclosed space, a home or garage.<br/>
                ·         Get your disaster supply kit<br/>
                ·         Listen to local radio and television for updated information.<br/>
                ·         If you use a computer, keep files and operating systems backed up regularly.<br/>
                ·         Consider buying extra batteries and a power converter if you use a laptop computer.<br/>
                ·         If you have an electric garage door opener, find out where the manual release lever is located and learn how to operate it.<br/>
                ·         Have a telephone that does not require the use of electricity to work (such as a cordless phone or answering machine), plan for alternate communication, including having a standard telephone handset with a standard cord, cellular telephone, radio, or pager.<br/>
                ·         Keep your car fuel tank at least half full because gas stations rely on electricity to power their pumps.<br/>
                <br/>
                What Do I Do During A Blackout?<br/>
                ·         Turn off or disconnect any appliances, equipment (like air conditioners) or electronics you were using when the power went out. When power comes back on, it may come back with momentary “surges” or “spikes” that can damage equipment such as computers and motors in appliances like the air conditioner, refrigerator, washer, or furnace.<br/>
                ·         Leave one light turned on so you’ll know when your power returns.<br/>
                ·         Leave the doors of your refrigerator and freezer closed to keep your food as fresh as possible.<br/>
                ·         Use the phone for emergencies only. Listening to a portable radio can provide the latest information. Do not call 9-1-1 for information — only call to report a life-threatening emergency.<br/>
                ·         Eliminate unnecessary travel, especially by car. Traffic signals will stop working during an outage, creating traffic congestion.<br/>
                ·         Remember that equipment such as automated teller machines (ATMs) and elevators may not work during a power outage.<br/>
                ·         If it is hot outside, take steps to remain cool. Move to the lowest level of your home, as cool air falls. Wear lightweight, light-colored clothing. Drink plenty of water, even if you do not feel thirsty. If the heat is intense and the power may be off for a long time, consider going to a movie theater, shopping mall, or “cooling shelter” that may be opened in your community. Listen to local radio or television for more information.<br/>
                ·         Remember to provide plenty of fresh, cool water for your pets.<br/>
                ·         If it is cold outside, put on layers of warm clothing. Never burn charcoal for heating or cooking indoors.<br/>
                ·         Never use your oven as a source of heat. If the power may be out for a prolonged period, plan to go to another location (relative, friend, or public facility) that has heat to keep warm.<br/><br/>
